What is java program?

Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object Oriented and secure programming language.

Java was developed by Sun Microsystem (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995.James Gosling is known as the father of Java.

Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment,(JRE) and API, it is called a platform.

Application --->
1. Desktop applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.
2. Web applications suggest irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.
3. Entire application such as banking application
4. Mobile
5. Embedded system
6. Smart card 
7. Robotics
8. Games etc

Features of Java --->

Simple:
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:

-> Java syntax is based on C++ ( so easier for programmers to learn it after C++)

-> Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.

-> There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java.

Object Oriented:
Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behaviour.

Platform Independents:
Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like C. C++, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs

Secured:
Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:

-> No explicit pointer

-> Java Programs run inside a virtual machine sandbox

Robust:
The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:

-> It uses strong memory management.

-> There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.

-> Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.

Architecture-natural:
Java is architecture natural because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.

Portable:
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.

High-performance:
Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code.

Distributed:
Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java.

Multi-threaded:
A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.

Dynamic:
Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.
